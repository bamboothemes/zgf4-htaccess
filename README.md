### Installation
This is a complete htaccess file for Joomla. You can use this to overwrite an existing unmodified htaccess file. If you have made changes to your Joomla htaccess file then please back up your existing file and add any snippets that you do not already have in your htaccess file.

Be sure to use the correct file for your version of Apache.
